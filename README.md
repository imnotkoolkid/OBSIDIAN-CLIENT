## Issues

Since the project was dropped midway, there are some known problems you should be aware of:

-  **Performance isn't optimized**: Even with uncapped FPS, performance is significantly lower compared to other clients.
-  **Play Freeze Bug**: There's a known issue where the players freezes during play. It doesn‚Äôt crash, but gets stuck for a few seconds.
-  **No further development**: These issues won‚Äôt be patched by the original devs unless the project is revived.

If you're planning to fork or use this client, feel free to improve on these ‚Äî PRs are always welcome if this ever gets active again.
